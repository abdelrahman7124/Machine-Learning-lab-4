1. Silhouette Score

Range: [-1, 1]
Better: Higher is better (closer to 1)
What it measures: How well each point fits in its assigned cluster compared to other clusters
How it works:

For each point, calculates:

a(i): Average distance to other points in the same cluster (cohesion)
b(i): Average distance to points in the nearest different cluster (separation)


Formula: (b - a) / max(a, b)
Values near +1: Point is well-matched to its cluster
Values near 0: Point is on the border between clusters
Values near -1: Point is probably in the wrong cluster




2. Davies-Bouldin Index

Range: [0, ∞)
Better: Lower is better (closer to 0)
What it measures: Average similarity ratio between each cluster and its most similar cluster
How it works:

For each cluster, calculates its "spread" (average distance from points to centroid)
Compares each cluster to all others by computing: (spread_i + spread_j) / distance_between_centroids
Takes the maximum ratio for each cluster (worst case)
Averages across all clusters
Lower values = clusters are far apart and compact
Higher values = clusters overlap or are too spread out




3. Calinski-Harabasz Index (Variance Ratio Criterion)

Range: [0, ∞)
Better: Higher is better
What it measures: Ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance
How it works:

Between-cluster dispersion (BCSS): How far cluster centroids are from the overall data centroid (separation)
Within-cluster dispersion (WCSS): How spread out points are within each cluster (compactness)
Formula: (BCSS / (k-1)) / (WCSS / (n-k))
Higher values = well-separated, compact clusters
Lower values = overlapping or loose clusters
Similar concept to F-statistic in ANOVA
